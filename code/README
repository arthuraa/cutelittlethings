Dependency
  Our program *does not depends on any external data source*.
  But during the preprocessing stage (the preprocessing did not play
  an important role, since it was done in early days, we did not want
  to roll back), we used other programs

1.We used the GNU aspell (built in biglab) program to do the spell checking
  in matlab, first save vocab as a text file.
  We have included a cell2csv.m file to help you saving.
  type
___________________________________________________________
  cell2csv('vocab.back.txt', vocab,'\n')
___________________________________________________________

  then in the shell
___________________________________________________________
  aspell -a < vocab.back.txt > vocab.replace.txt
___________________________________________________________

  then we used vocab.ml (ocaml script, biglab has ocaml3.12 installed) to
  parse the vocab.replace.txt
  in the ocaml interactive just type the commands.
___________________________________________________________
  #load "vocab.ml"
___________________________________________________________
  Ocaml code depends on a community library called batteries that
  is a defacto standard library.

  It will generate a file *'mapping_index_stemming.txt'*, and
  other useless files for debugging purposes.

  In the script file vocab.ml, after correcting spelling, the python
  script stem.py is invoked, to stem the words using the nltk package.

  ___________________________________________________________
  #u "./stem.py > mapping_stemming.txt" ;;
  ___________________________________________________________


   To conclude, our main matlab file run_submission.m depends on
   only one file 'mapping_index_stemming.txt' which is built as
   described above,  If you have any trouble in building such a file,
   my email address * bobzhang1988@gmail.com * , we would be happy to help.

   We have included mapping_index_stemming.txt for your convenience.
   In general, the spell checking seems to have a minor improvement,
   the stemming does not make sense, but we did not want to roll back :-)


2. in run_submission.m

   There are some places that look weird, like saving a file and
   loading it immediately afterwards. The reason for this is that we
   saved some intermediate results to save loading time. However, this
   shouldn't be a problem.

3. Additional things

   Other run_*.m files contain code for linear regression
   (discriminative method), KNN (instance-based method) and mixture of
   gaussians (generative) models. Our main SVM submission also uses
   other features, which count as the fourth requirement, such as the
   spell checked words mentioned above, text length and the "helpful"
   features.

Thanks!
